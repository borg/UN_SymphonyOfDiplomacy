Symphony of Diplomacy

A sample project for the UN conference - [Humanicy](http://www.faf.org/main/current-projects/humanicy/)



The face expressions and head movements of 9 political leaders are being tracked and sent to Logic music program over midi to generate sound.

I will post a tutorial on the midi control setup over at [crea.tion.to](http://crea.tion.to) shortly.
